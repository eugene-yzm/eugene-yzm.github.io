Hello visitor!

I am Eugene, an electrical engineer graduating from University of Waterloo in Spring 2017.  My technical background spans from integrated and RF circuit design, to embedded systems, to software development.  I am currently looking for opportunities in a full time software development position.  In particular, I am interested in the backend side of products: looking at challenges in distributed computation, scalability, and building robust infrastructure.

A unique feature of my university, the "Co-operative education" program: we are expected to complete 5-6 four month internships in order to graduate!  When I started out, I was but a young fledgeling not knowing how to apply my knowledge to real world problems.  Since then, I have becoming more confident in my abilities and am excited for what's next in store.  Co-op has given me the opportunity to work with awesome people to work on interesting technical challenges. 

Research topics I'm keeping my eyes on:
* bionics
* robotics
* machine learning
* AI

My hobbies include:
* music: *I am a huge __huge__ music connoisseur, and I also play a couple of instruments as well*
* fine arts: *I almost went to art school to study illustration*
* anime: ***ahem!** anime is the greatest*
* gastronomy: *I like it but I'm not good at it :(*
* travelling: *one of my life goals is to see the world*
